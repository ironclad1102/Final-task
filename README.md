Insights & optimisation ideas

Send more SMS reminders – model weights show reminders cut no‑show odds by ~15 %. Automate messages 24 h & 3 h before the slot.

Age‑tailored follow‑ups – children (<12) and seniors (>60) have higher risk. Add phone confirmation for those groups.

Weekend effect – Sat/Sun (weekday ≥ 5) raise risk ~5 %. Consider over‑booking slight buffer on weekends or shift non‑urgent visits to weekdays.

Same‑week scheduling – long gaps (>30 days) between scheduling and appointment correlate with more misses. Offer nearer slots when possible.

No‑show penalty / reward – gentle policies (reminder of wait‑list impact, quick rescheduling) shown to improve adherence.
